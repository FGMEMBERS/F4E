Change Log and ToDo List
version 0.6.0 INW
-- Changing 3D instruments to new OSG clickable versions

version 0.5.5
-- Tweaked FDM: limited elevator to -30 down, now full stick forward does not cause departure
-- Installed lower left panel with flaps, slats, and gear indicator

version 0.5.4
-- Minor changes to NASAL scripts
-- Reversed Heading bug hotspots.

version 0.5.3
-- Working on the 3D radar display.  Cockpit view not as pretty for now.
-- Changed ASI textures
-- Main panel texture not transparent anymore so hotspots show up better.

version 0.5.2
-- Fixed 3D model's centers so it rotates correctly in external views.
-- Changes to the FDM
-- Added EGT gauges
-- Started on the 3D radar display.  Cockpit view not as pretty for now.

version 0.5.1
-- Adjusted the FDM
-- Dragchute functions under ctrl-d.  It's a straight toggle at the moment so you can use it more than once per sortie...
-- Added some panel hot spots.  Instrument lights are controlled by clicking near the knob on upper left under TAS gauge.

-- Added hotspots for HSI course and heading knobs.
-- Added bearing and heading bugs to HSI.

version 0.5
-- Replaced Airspeed Indicator
-- Moved pilot view 0.05 meters forward

version 0.4
-- Converted to JSBSim 2.0 (Broke dragchute)
-- Good start on the 3D cockpit (almost done)

version 0.3
-- Adjusted wing tank positions
-- Replaced 2D panel AOA, added indexers.
-- Added some 3D instruments.
-- There is now a drag chute, but it must be activated from the property tree
-- Played around with the FDM

version 0.2
-- Increased fuel capacity to 1885 gallons internal and 1340 external
-- Adjusted fuel quantity gauges to lbs x 10,000 instead of lbs x 1000.
