The F-4E was enhanced during and after its production. One of the particular limitations of the Phantom was that it had been designed basically as an interceptor and strike aircraft, not a dogfighter, and maneuverability had suffered as a result. The lack of maneuverability proved troublesome in combat, particularly since under certain aggressive flight conditions, the F-4 could go into a spin that generally required immediate ejection if the aircraft was below 3,000 meters (10,000 feet). This unpleasant behavior came as something of a nasty shock, since flying the Phantom under peacetime conditions was very straightforward, one pilot calling it "idiot-proof", and it had an admirable flight safety record.

In response to the maneuverability problems, a program named "Agile Eagle" was initiated, in which the Phantom was fitted with various experimental aerodynamic modifications. The solution in the end was to fit the wing with leading-edge slats, which extended automatically when the aircraft's AOA exceeded six degrees, and retracted when the AOA went back to four degrees. Installation of the slats required removal of the BLC system.

The leading-edge slats were introduced into F-4Es beginning in mid-1972 and were retrofitted to older aircraft. Beginning the next year, 1973, F-4Es went through a structural strengthening program after an F-4E was lost due to a wing structural failure.

The Northrop "Target Identification System Electro-Optical (TISEO)" camera system was also introduced in late F-4E production and retrofitted to older aircraft. TISEO involved a steerable, stabilized telescopic camera mounted on the left wing, and was used primarily to inspect targets before engaging them. TISEO imagery was displayed on the WSO's radarscope. The camera could be slaved to the AN/APQ-120 radar, and apparently there was an upgrade that allowed it to be linked to the navigation system to target flight checkpoints as well. Of course, it was a daylight / clear-weather only system. Most export F-4Es were not fitted with TISEO.
